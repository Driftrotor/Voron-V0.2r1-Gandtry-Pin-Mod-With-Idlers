# Voron V0.2r1 Gantry Pin Mod With Idlers
 adds pins for the bearing stacks instead of screws

This mod should address the tollerence issue with regards to the bearing stacks and the screws that hold them in place.
wanting a better fit to give a better, more precice motion system helps the printer to maintain better repeatablility when i comes to movements.
it also help keep those resonance charts looking a bit cleaner as the pins are a much closer match to the inner diameter of the bearing, so reducing bearing chatter.
no more will you have the issue of over tightening the bearing stacks.

instalation is kept as simple as possible and closely follows the manual.

the only difference with the gantry is placing the pins in the lower printed parts, adding the bearing stacks with the washers and pressing on the upper printed parts.

for the idlers you will need to press in the pins into the lower printed parts, screw the M3x10 BHCS (replaces M3x35 BHCS) into the front of the frame, then add the bearings stacks and washers before pressibg on the top printed parts.

NOTE - the hole for the pin has a tight tollerence! (3.1mm) it may be nessecary to use a 3mm drill bit to ream the hole out to get the pin to fit.

you will want to measure the drill bit first with a vernier caliper to make shure that the drill bit is no bigger than 3mm.

ream it out by hand! (ask me why i know this :P)

this will give you a nice press fit for the pins!

you want it to be a press fit or the pin will have too much tollerenace to move and make the hole bigger!

I have been using the pin mod here for over 6 months now with hundreds of hours of print time at chamber temps over 60 degrees and have had no issues with it. the pins are still firmly held in place as when i first installed them.

both ABS and ASA are good materials for this!
